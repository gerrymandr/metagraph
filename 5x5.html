    <h1>Redistricting a 5x5 Grid</h1>
    <img width="200" src="imgs/blankgrid5.png?raw=true" alt="A 5-by-5 grid">
  </header>

  <main>
    <p>
      Now let's consider how to redistrict a 5x5 grid into 5 rook-contiguous districts of 5 units each.
      (Gridlandia has grown!)
      There
      are 4006 districting plans $\mathcal D$ that satisfy these criteria, and we can construct the metagraph in the
      same way as
      <a href="./4x4.html">before</a>&mdash;with
      a node for each plan and an edge between plans that can be transformed into each other by one step (swapping two
      cells in
      adjacent districts). We can write these all down, but the full visualization is hard to work with.
      Instead, we'll show a local picture of the metagraph where you can see a districting plan and all of the other
      plans within two steps.
    </p>

    <h3>A local view of the metagraph</h3>
    <p>
      Click on a plan in the local metagraph (at right) to put it in the center and study its 2-neighborhood.
      (Note: we're not showing the connections between the neighbors, but only how they relate to the center node.)
      Alternatively, use the panel on the
      left to build a districting plan $\mathcal D$
      from scratch, one district at a time, and jump directly to it.
      You can change the vote distribution $\Delta$ by
      clicking the units to toggle the vote between the two parties, and watch
      the winning side change in the metagraph.
    </p>


    <div id="chart1" class="chart three-columns"></div>

    <p>Try exploring: create a distribution $\Delta$ that's about half and half split between the parties, start with
      any initial plan $\mathcal D$, and try clicking your way around the metagraph and looking for areas
      that favor one party or the other.
    </p>
    <h3>Statistics over the metagraph</h3>
    <p>
      Since there are 4006 possible districting plans, it's hard to use such a zoomed-in view to get a good sense of
      the universe of possibilities. Furthermore, there are $2^{25}=33,554,432$ possible voting distributions,
      even before we allow units to split their votes, since each of the 25 units can go for either party.
      For a particular vote distribution $\Delta$,
      we might happen to be in an area of the metagraph where many plans give the <span class="hearts">Hearts</span>
      Party the majority of seats, even though globally the <span class="clubs">Clubs</span> Party does better
      far more of the time.
    </p>

    <p>
      Instead of trying to visualize the whole metagraph, we can compute some <strong>statistics</strong> about all
      possible $\mathcal D$ with respect to a fixed distribution of votes $\Delta$
      and also for all possible distributions of votes $\Delta$ with respect to a fixed plan $\mathcal D$.
      Below, you can build a plan using the panel on the left, or scroll back up to pick a plan from the last figure.
      The selected plan will be displayed next to the navigator panel. You can click and toggle $\Delta$ as
      before. Finally, there are two histograms.
    </p>

    <p>
      The first histogram fixes your districting plan but varies the vote distribution over all the possibilities

      with the same proportion of voters for each party. (For instance, if your $\Delta$ has 9
      <span class="clubs">Clubs</span> units, then it is compared against the ${25 \choose 9}=2,042,975$ distributions
      that are also 36% <span class="clubs">Clubs</span>.)
      The number of
      <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> seats for your $(\mathcal D,\Delta)$

      is indicated by the <span class="green">Green</span> bar.
    </p>

    <p>
      The second histogram shows how many <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> seats your distribution
      gives over all 4006 possible districting plans. The number of <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> seats
      in your selected plan is indicated by the <span class="blue">Blue</span> bar.
    </p>

    <div id="chart2" class="chart three-columns"></div>

    <h3>Interpretation</h3>
    <p>
      How should we interpret this?
    </p>


    <h4>Fixed $\Delta$, varied $\mathcal D$</h4>
    <p>
      Now suppose, for a fixed distribution of votes, that your plan performed very extremely&mdash;it's in a
      <span class="blue">Blue</span> bar that's far to the left or the right of the bulk of the distribution.
      Perhaps this occurred by chance, but another thing this could mean is that the favored party had
      a good prediction of where the vote would fall and drew the lines to carefully extract electoral advantage
      from that pattern&mdash;gerrymandering!
    </p>

    <h4>Varying $\Delta$ with fixed party shares</h4>
    <p>
      This lets you explore whether the layout of voters, itself, is skewing the representation away from
      proportionality.
      For instance, consider all the
      voter distributions that have just four <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> units in the grid. Most
      of them don't yield even one way to get a <span class="hearts">Hearts</span> district, but if you
      place them close together, then over 41% of plans do give representation to the <span class="hearts">Hearts</span>
      party.
    </p>


    <p>
      Next, we'll look at the 7x7 grid, which has too many valid districting plans for us to actually write down, so
      we'll have to develop some more sophisticated methods to do these kinds of statistical comparisons.
